TODO
===============
1. test bufferbloat avoidance on OF13 using 2 equal bw queues
2. traffic classification
  1. empirical method, run a separate linux namespace
  2. think about the fish eye (zooming in zooming out approach to statistics)
3. traffic placement
  1. extend ECMP (it may not work in general topologies)
  2. randomized algorithm (for short flows) 
  3. something like DevoFlows or Hedera for long flows
4. traffic differentiation
  1. start with 2 queues to avoid bufferbloat
  2. vary resource allocation dynamically
  3. transparent tcp split / multipath tcp
5. validation in mininet, simulator, matlab and GENI/FIBRE
